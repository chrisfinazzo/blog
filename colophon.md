#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Chris Finazzo. A communications guy by day and web technology nerd by night (and weekends). I go by **@chrisfinazzo** in the [usual]({{ site.github.url }}) [places]({{ site.twitter.url }}) online.

#### What hardware do you use?

Since 2007, I have almost exclusively used Apple computers and iOS devices. My primary machine these days is a [2013 15" Retina MacBook Pro][]. It's mostly stock with the one exception being RAM (for obvious reasons). It's fair to say that having an SSD has changed my computing life in ways that I can't begin to describe. I still keep around the hard disk from a [Dell Latitude D610][] that I took to college for those rare instances when I need to need to do something with Windows.

I carry an [iPhone 6][] with me wherever I go. An [iPad Air 2][] fulfills my browsing and reading needs when I'm away from the laptop.

Storage and backup is handled through Time Machine and a combination of external drives. Today, Western Digital drives fill this role as they have proven to be resilient over the years.

My current router is a [Linksys WRT 1900 AC][]. Although I try not to use it, any printing is done through a [HP OfficeJet 6700][] connected via Ethernet<sup id="fn1-colophon"><a href="#fn1-colophon">1</a></sup>  to the 1900AC.

#### And what software?

To the extent that I can, all writing and coding is done in [BBEdit][]. I run this site using [Jekyll][] and a combination of other [scripts][], mostly written in [bash][]. [Homebrew][] is my package manager of choice. Just in case, I still keep around a version of Gruber's original [Markdown][] script for those times when I need to transform something on the fly. All of this work is versioned using [Git][].

I browse the web using [Safari][] and [Chrome][]. Over time, I have learned to practice [sane][] RSS usage.

On iOS, most of my time is spent in [Instapaper][], Mail, [Reeder][], and a constantly changing selection of games.

#### What would be your dream setup?

I have so many complaints about the tools I use that it's [absurd][]. That said, the biggest improvement I would want is a faster network connection. In an ideal scenario, this would be a wired connection for any computer and all other devices would use the fastest wireless connection that they support.
