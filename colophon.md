#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Chris Finazzo. A library and communications guy by day and web technology nerd by night (and weekends). I go by **@chrisfinazzo** in the [usual]({{ site.github.url }}) [places]({{ site.twitter.url }}) online.

#### What hardware do you use?

Since 2007, I have almost exclusively used Apple computers and devices. My primary machine these days is a [2020 13" MacBook Pro][]. It's one of the 4 port USB-C models whose only customization was a 2 TB SSD.<sup id="fn1-colophon"><a href="#fn1-colophon">1</a></sup> I still keep around the hard disk from a [Dell Latitude D610][] - the first laptop that I took to college - for those rare instances when I need to need to do something with Windows.

I carry an [iPhone 14 Pro][] with me wherever I go. An [iPad Air 2][] fulfills my browsing and reading needs when I'm away from the laptop. After using a Fitbit for a few years, I traded up to an [Apple Watch SE][] in December 2020.

Local backups are done through Time Machine and a Western Digital drive which is connected via USB. [Backblaze][] handles sending bits safely to the cloud.

My current router is a [Linksys WRT 1900 AC][]. Although I try not to use them, any printing is done through a set of HP printers - an [OfficeJet Pro 6978][] or an [OfficeJet Pro 9015][], both of which are connected via Wi-Fi to the 1900AC.<sup id="fn2-colophon"><a href="#fn2-colophon">2</a></sup>

#### And what software?

To the extent that I can, all writing and coding is done in [BBEdit][]. I run this site using [Jekyll][] and a combination of other [scripts][], written in [zsh][] inside a Rakefile. For most things, [Homebrew][] is my package manager of choice. The lone exception is if I am working on a [Standard Ebooks][] project, which uses Python for its toolset. This particular set of scripts is accessed via a virtual environment managed by [Miniconda][].<sup id="fn3-colophon"><a href="#fn3-colophon">3</a></sup>

Just in case, I still keep around a version of John's [Markdown][] script for those times when I need to transform something on the fly. All of this work is versioned using [Git][].

I browse the web using [Safari][], but keep [Firefox][] and [Chrome][] around for their excellent development tools.

[Chrome]: https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/

On iOS, most of my time is spent in [Audible][], Mail, [NetNewsWire][], [Overcast][] and a constantly changing selection of games.

#### What would be your dream setup?

I have so many complaints about the tools I use that it's [absurd][]. That said, the biggest improvement I would want is a faster network connection. In an ideal scenario, this would be a wired connection for any computer and all other devices would use the fastest wireless connection that they support.
