Like the author of this piece, you're probably thinking, 'who prints things'?, well sometimes there's just no way around it. I've experimented with setting the media type to `print` in the past, but the results were inconsistent. BBEdit's Preview window _can_ do this, however it required a bunch of manual fiddling, generating a bunch of scratch PDF copies as I went along.

This seems like it could be a much better solution.
