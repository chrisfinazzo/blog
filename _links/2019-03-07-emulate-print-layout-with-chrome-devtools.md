Like the author of this piece, you’re probably thinking, 'Who prints things?', well sometimes there’s just no way around it. I’ve experimented with setting the media type to “print” in the past, but the results were inconsistent. BBEdit’s Preview window can do this, however it required a significant of manual fiddling, generating a bunch of scratch PDF copies as I went along. This seems like it could be a much better solution.
