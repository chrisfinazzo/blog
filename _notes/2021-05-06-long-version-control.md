_Noun_.

The process which often occurs after a substantial change to a project where - either due to complexity or the passage of time - it is near impossible to remember what was actually done. This makes creating sensible commits difficult and usually involves running `git difftool` on individual files to come up with a reasonable explanation of how the problem was solved or a new feature added.

Side effects can include a large number of editor windows and cognitive overload.

A form of [Yak shaving][].
