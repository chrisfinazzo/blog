title: Work in Progress

Behind the scenes, I've been working on a number of fairly substantial changes to the site. While the look hasn't changed all that much, under the hood, it's a definite step up.

In the spirit of the [Indieweb][], notes - e.g, microblog-style posts, reposts, and replies - are in and the linkblog has been improved (they're both powered by Jekyll's support for [collections][]). I also rebuilt the way layouts are handled and - in true Jekyll style - all of them now inherit from the default one.

Liquid templates have their quirks, but the whole process wasn't overly difficult.
