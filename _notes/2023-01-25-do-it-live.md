It looks like I may need to do the syndication bit manually, at least until things get sorted out in the relevant pull request. In addition, although there are no permalinks on the Notes homepage, these items are still reachable if you think about what to do for a moment.

Individual notes still have a date based on their filename, but I'm removing this part from the layout to see if it looks better.
