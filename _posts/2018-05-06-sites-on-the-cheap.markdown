title: Sites on the Cheap
---

As this site&#8217;s content has become a bit of a running commentary regarding its own creation, let&#8217;s continue with that theme. 

I really like what @parkr did with his [Stuff][] repo - just a simple microsite for collecting links to interesting things he finds - so I decided to do the same. I called it Links (because why not), just to avoid any namespace conflicts with other things already in my Home directory. Of course, it needs to live somewhere, and since I like to keep things as simple as possible, I decided to use a subdomain (e.g, links.chrisfinazzo.com).

I seem to remember @imathis built a [plugin][] for doing linkblog style entries, but I don&#8217;t know if it was ever ported to Jekyll 3. Parker created a bunch of tasks for doing these kinds of things in a Rakefile, so I&#8217;ll see if that works out better. It might even give me some ideas for how to build out my Jekyll Scripts [repo][], which itself could use an update one of these days.
