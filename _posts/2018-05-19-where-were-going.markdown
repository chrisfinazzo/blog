title: Where We&#8217;re Going, We Don&#8217;t Need Subdomains
---

Subdomains are out and collections are in; which means a proper linkblog can live at the same domain as the rest of the site. It took some time - reading docs, asking questions on the [Jekyll Talk][] forum, and watching a CloudCannon tutorial - but now, interesting links have their own index (naturally, it&#8217;s `/links`) and associated URLs.

This also solves a problem I was never able to find a good solution for the first time around - linking to external sites from the title of a post. [Octopress][], a Jekyll fork by Brandon Mathis, implemented this feature in the form of a plugin called [Linkblog][], but unfortunately it hasn&#8217;t seen an update since 2015 when Brandon announced he was embarking on a ground-up rewrite of the code.

_Maybe_, _just maybe_, this will be the push I need to whittle down the [Siracusian][] number of tabs I have open on my phone.

At last count, it was 106.
