> _You say you want to write for a living, just do it._

I had a phone call recently with someone I met through networking and he said these words to me at the end of our conversation. For the longest time, I spent a large portion of my time trying to get all of the technical parts of a site together before actually putting pen to paper &ndash; or, in this case &ndash; fingers to keyboard.

This got me thinking about my [Reverse Job Posting][] and what went into building that site. Is it the most attractive site possible? No. _Far_ from it. However it _is_ the smallest possible thing I could think of in order to give people a jumping off point to find programming projects and writing samples I&#8217;ve worked on. All-together, it took me a week from start to finish.

Without realizing it, trying to come up with the most technically interesting solution was a barrier that kept me from writing. Playing around with raw HTML or alternative blogging engines was an interesting exercise, but what it comes down to is that I was just &#8220;spinning my wheels&#8221;.

With that lesson in mind, I&#8217;m back to using Jekyll with a couple of scripts to make the writing process easier.
