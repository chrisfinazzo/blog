title: A Brief Reprieve
---

I don&#8217;t know how long it will remain, but the potential endgame for Safari extensions described in my [last][] post may be further off in the future than originally thought. After all, Apple isn&#8217;t [Bare Bones][], who extensively document how to restore prior behaviors in their apps - usually by editing a [property list][]. As time goes on, I would expect the number of hurdles that must jump through in order to continue use legacy extensions to increase, but the inclusion of the &#8220;unsigned&#8221; [option][] in the _**Develop**_ menu gives me hope.

For now, the search for Chrome versions of all my extensions continues apace, as I don&#8217;t know how Safari 12&#8217;s Intelligent Tracking Prevention might reduce the need for some of the customizations I&#8217;ve made. 

Maybe I&#8217;m just [out of touch][] or I&#8217;m [in too deep][]&#8230;
