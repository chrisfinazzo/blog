title: Social Distancing Part 4 - When Government (Almost) Gets It Right
---

So it has come down to this. A topic I thought I would *never, ever* write about here. But, through a series of mostly COVID-19 related events, here we are.

Politics. Specifically, the United States Census.

It happens every 10 years, but honestly I&#8217;ve never given it much thought. As with voting, time has a way of grabbing your attention at moments that used to just pass by.{% fn 1 %} Because I had some extra time on my hands, I even applied to work at a local office in my district. For whatever reason, this exercise didn&#8217;t pan out. Also, this was before coronavirus, when you could do amazing things like actually _work with other people in the same place without social distancing_.

It started on YouTube. I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;ve done it in the past, but the people at Sesame Workshop put together a short video{% fn 2 %} to encourage everyone to respond to the Census. Popular culture tends to depict the process as kind of a drag and an artifact of a bygone era, so getting everyone on board requires getting a little creative.

The result is [brilliant][]. Short, to the point, free of political bias, and presented in a way that makes even little kids feel like they&#8217;re part of the process.{% fn 3 %}

With &#8220;stay-at-home&#8221; orders in place the past few weeks, it became clear that people wouldn&#8217;t be canvassing the neighborhood anytime soon. That raises the question, &#8216;could the government actually pull this off online?&#8217;

Surprisingly, the answer seems to be yes - with the exception of one quirk I&#8217;ll get to in a moment. Just go to the [website][] and click &#8220;Start Questionnaire&#8221;. Like they say, the process literally takes 10 minutes and anyone should be able to get through it.

Looking at the site&#8217;s design, it seems to be the work of the [USDS][], who, along with [18F][] are trying to keep the Federal government's technology infrastructure in running order. In some ways, I&#8217;m reminded of the UK&#8217;s equivalent, [GOV.UK][], although the US hasn&#8217;t yet put all of its sites under one roof. When so much of government feels like it&#8217;s in disarray, it&#8217;s good to know there are at least a few experts left, even if their work goes unnoticed most of the time.

That is, until I clicked submit &mdash; whereupon the site deleted my responses and made me start _all over again_.
