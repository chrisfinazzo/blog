title: Audible, Goodreads, and a Very Long List
---

Because all [the][] [cool][] [kids][] are doing it, I&#8217;ve compiled a list of all the books I&#8217;ve read in the past year. You might think, &#8216;Who reads anymore&#8217;, or &#8216;Who has the time?&#8217; Surprisingly, this was easier than I thought and only required 3 things&#58;

### An Audible subscription

Audiobooks have come a long way from the books on tape I remember listening to growing up. Long books felt shorter, and because there were no visuals involved, I found it easier to retain information, especially when it came to more complicated topics. Still, this approach is not without its drawbacks; The basic account only gives you 1 credit per month, and I&#8217;ve never really been tempted by the Audible Originals. However, the selection is really good and since [they&#8217;re][] an Amazon company, the service is always up.

Well worth the $15.

### A Goodreads account

I have a note in iCloud (and a Reminders list) to keep track of things, but for now, the canonical record is located [here][]. The website may be kind of ugly, but it does a decent job keeping track of what I&#8217;ve read and what my next pick should be.

### Time to listen

This is a big one &mdash; having a walkable commute in addition to a working environment where I can listen while doing other things has been a great aid to this process.
