title: The Future of Safari Extensions
---

In most technology circles, hearing somebody say &#8220;the Future of X&#8221; when referring to a given technology is a bad sign. It&#8217;s the death knell, usually means time is running out, and a big change is on the horizon. With this in mind, The Safari team [announced][] at WWDC that legacy `.safariextz` extensions distributed outside of the Extensions Gallery will not load in Safari 12. While they will accept new submissions until the end of this year, it&#8217;s clear that App Extensions and Content Blockers are the future of extensibility in Safari.

This wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if the app install/uninstall experience on the Mac wasn&#8217;t _terrible_ - one thing that I actually miss from the days when I used Windows regularly. Microsoft gets flack for using a centralized database (the [Registry][]) to handle this, but for the most part it does the job.

Generally speaking, most of the extensions I use are to correct webpage behaviors ([Detox][], [PageOne][]) or prevent certain things from loading ([JavaScript Blacklist][], [Right Exit][]). I&#8217;m not sure how much of this is actually necessary as Safari in Mojave improves tracking prevention - which mitigates some of these issues, but I suspect I&#8217;ll want to go one step further. To that end, I&#8217;m looking for equivalent extensions to replicate my Safari setup in Chrome.

Of course, there&#8217;s a reason why I don&#8217;t run as many extensions in Chrome: The web store is a [mess][]. Google doesn&#8217;t curate _anything_ and it shows.
