title: Security by Deletion
---
I guess there's a first time for everything, so imagine my surprise when an email from GitHub about a security warning showed up in my Inbox this past week.

Granted, the Node ecosystem has a large number of modules, each with their own dependencies which may have security vulnerabilities from time to time. Nothing really surprising about that...with one exception. 

The specific vulnerability is in a sub dependency of a module I don't control and the supposed fix is to bump the version number in `package-lock.json`. However, this file is automatically generated by `npm install` and is a way to ensure you install the correct version of a module. The prevailing opinion, based on what I've read, is that tweaking the file on your own is not recommended unless you are really confident in what you're doing.

_My fix_? Remove Workbox and rewrite my Service Worker by hand. In total, it's 63 lines of code, most of which I'd already [written][] for Minima.
